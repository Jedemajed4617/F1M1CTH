Review of the game:

Welcome back to a new game review, This review we are going to talk about Fifa 22.
Although Fifa has come out with the same game over and over again it has some new
awesome features. 

For instance: Hypermotion, keepers and players rewritten to new offense attacks,
Volta football is back with more locations to play, FUT has been updated and 
has been improved, a lot of new players have been added who are new.

Now that has all been said, the game is still very simular to the other fifa's.
for instance it is still the same game only with a bit of improvement in graphical
design and movement of the players. And every year you have the same gameplay with
with a new fifa coming out, just with improvements.
